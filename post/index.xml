      <description>Elastic Search, Logstash and Kibana This quick post will get you up and running with the elk stack.
Please clone my github repository where the scripts I created live and so that you can follow along with the post.
Go to Elkstack Practice
If you want to generate movies.json then do the following command:
go run main.go &amp;gt; movies.json

      <description>Restful API Testing API testing is a necessary task to do while building APIs.
Instead of using a browser or typing into a UI and clicking buttons, you can test APIs using tools such as Curl and Postman.
Using a Rest Client you can make Rest calls such as for HTTP Verbs such as:
 GET POST PUT DELETE PATCH  When we test an API, we deal with JSON, XML, and Web Services.</description>

      <description>Page Objects What are Page Objects? Page Object Blog Post by Martin Fowler
 A page object wraps an HTML page, or fragment, with an application-specific API, allowing you to manipulate page elements without digging around in the HTML.
 Page objects are a way to describe UI interactions in your page with application specific terminology instead of HTML specific language.
This in turn helps you write tests that are more clear and also helps you be more dry (Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat yourself) because you can reuse your page objects in other acceptance/end-to-end tests</description>

      <description>Command Line Applications Building command line applications is a refreshing change to building UIs. In this blog post I go over briefly my thoughts on building commandline apps with Node.js and Golang
Node.js CommandLine First off I did not use a commander.js or any third party libraries to make my contrived application. I used vanilla node.js
&#39;use strict&#39;; const process = require(&#39;process&#39;); const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;); const lib = require(&#39;.</description>

 Interesting Points of the Course What was surprising What Mark Miller did well What could have been done better Purchase the Course  Interesting Points of the Course  An interesting fact of the course is how much proximity plays a role with UI. If elements of a UI are placed in close proximity, users typically assume they are related  So if you should group related items in a UI in close proximity</description>

      <description>Caching What Is Caching?  Caching is the term for storing reusable responses in order to make subsequent requests faster. There are different types of caching available. Application caches and memory caches are both popular for their ability to speed up certain responses.  Types of Cache  Disk cache: The page cache in main memory is managed by the operating system kernel. Web cache Memoization  A cache can store data that is computed on demand rather than retrieved from a backing store.</description>

Table of Contents  Introduction Characteristics of Good APIs  Easy to learn and memorize Leads to readable code Hard to misuse Easy to extend Complete  The Design Process  Know the requirements Write use cases before you write any other code Look for similar APIs in the same library Define the API before you implement it Have your peers review your API Write several examples against the API Prepare for extensions Don’t publish internal APIs without review When in doubt, leave it out  Design Guidelines  Choose self-explanatory names and signatures Choose unambiguous names for related things Beware of false consistency Avoid abbreviations Prefer specific names to general names Don&amp;rsquo;t be a slave of an underlying API&amp;rsquo;s naming practices  Semantics  Choose good defaults Avoid making your apis overly clever Pay attention to edge cases Be careful when defining virtual APIs  Structural  Strive for property-based APIs The best API is no API  Bread Crumb Navigation Github Repository  Introduction  An application programming interface, or API, is the set of symbols that are exported and available to the users of a library to write their applications.</description>
