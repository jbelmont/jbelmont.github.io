      <description>About Papers We Love  What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just gives other members a proper rundown about the paper. Try to come to each session with an open mind, listen, discuss, and learn.</description>

      <description>Code Craftsmanship Saturdays  Code Craftsmanship Saturdays is a meetup group where people can learn and practice both new and old technologies in an informal environment. People learn best when paired in groups where they can share different ideas, thoughts, and approaches to problems. This group is heavily influenced from the Node School Organization, but is intended to be more generic in content. This code retreat is about practice, not about delivering a product on a deadline.</description>
