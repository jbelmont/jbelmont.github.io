      <description>Code Craftsmanship Saturdays  Code Craftsmanship Saturdays is a meetup group where people can learn and practice both new and old technologies in an informal environment. People learn best when paired in groups where they can share different ideas, thoughts, and approaches to problems. This group is heavily influenced from the Node School Organization, but is intended to be more generic in content. This code retreat is about practice, not about delivering a product on a deadline.</description>
